                    Christmas is coming, and it is going to be a difficult one due to the family's financial
                    woes: Homer's expected Christmas bonus at work does not come through, and the family is forced to
                    spend
                    money previously set aside for shopping on an expensive tattoo removal procedure for Bart. Homer
                    tries
                    to earn money by other means such as being a department store Santa Claus, and the family does their
                    best to have a good holiday in spite of the circumstances.

                    When the school has an intelligence test, Bart is considered to be a genius when he switches his
                    name
                    and Martin Prince's on the test's answer sheets. Bart is then enrolled in the Enriched Learning
                    Center
                    for Gifted Children, a school which quickly proves to be beyond his capabilities. The experience
                    actually brings Bart and Homer closer together, until Bart confesses to the switch.

                    Homer is fired from his nuclear technician job after he causes an accident due to being distracted
                    by greeting Bart and his class on their field trip to the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Depressed
                    and unemployed, Homer considers suicide until he notes the dangers around town and becomes a safety
                    crusader, which earns him the job of safety inspector. </p>

                    the picnic, Homer notices his own family's shortcomings and dysfunctions, so he decides to improve

                    only to find himself the target of constant bullying by Nelson and his two Weasels. With Grampa and
                    Herman's help, Bart then organizes many other students at school into an army to fight back against
                    Nelson. </p>
