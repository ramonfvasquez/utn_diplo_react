                742 Evergreen Terrace is the main location in The Simpsons and the address of the Simpson family's
                house. It first appeared in the short Good Night.
                <br />
                <br />
                The house first appears chronologically in the flashback episode 'Lisa's First Word'. In order for
                the Simpson family to purchase the home, Abraham Simpson II sold his old house and wrote Homer a
                check for $15,000, allowing Homer to make the down payment on the house. In 'No Loan Again,
                Naturally', it is revealed that the Simpsons are unable to afford their mortgage anymore, due to
                Homer constantly loaning money against the house, which causes Ned Flanders to purchase the property
                for $101,000 and rent it to the Simpsons.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 'I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings', it was revealed that the alarm code happened to be
                3679.
                <br />
                <br />
                It was one of the family homes, including the Old Simpson Farm, and the Simpson House Boat (both
                either destroyed or got a new owner).
                <br />
                <br />
                The house to the left of the Simpsons house at 744 Evergreen Terrace is the Flanders family house,
                which is owned by Ned Flanders.
                <br />
                <br />
                The house on the right at 740 Evergreen Terrance is possibly owned by Ted Flanders. It was formerly
                owned by Sideshow Bob (disguised as Walt Warren), Ruth Powers, Laura Powers, Sylvia Winfield, and
                Mr. Winfield, Terrence, and Emily (also home to Mr. Reader, Mrs. Reader and Baby Reader in The
                Simpsons Comic). In The Simpsons: Tapped Out, it is called the Brown House (about it, Homer says
                that 'We've lived next to that house for years and I've never seen anyone go in or out').
                <br />
                <br />
                One time, Marge mentioned that Evergreen Terrace is 'the street that smells like pee'. Strangely,
                former presidents George Bush and Gerald Ford have previously moved to Springfield in a house across
                the street. The house was destroyed in The Simpsons Movie and rebuilt in the exact same manner.
