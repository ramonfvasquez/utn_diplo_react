                    Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12) is the main protagonist and one of the five main characters of
                    The Simpsons series(or show). He is the spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie
                    Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240 pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around
                    him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have great caring, love, and even bravery to
                    those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He serves as the main protagonist of
                    the 2007 film adaptation.

                    His favorite color is blue and he enjoys dancing, eating donuts, hugging, driving a sit-down arcade
                    racer, playing the piano and horse riding. His favorite kiddie rides are 'Stuart Little', 'Barney
                    Train' and 'Ride the Champion Mechanical Horse'.

                    Homer works as a low-level safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G,
                    although he is often incompetent and negligent towards his duties. He spends a great deal of his
                    time at Moe's Tavern with his friends Barney Gumble, Carl Carlson, Lenny Leonard, and Moe Szyslak.
                    At home, he can often be found sitting on the couch mindlessly watching TV while snacking on food
                    and drinking Duff. Homer is also the only son of Abraham Simpson II and Mona Simpson. When provoked,
                    he often strangles Bart for pressuring him. Even though he mutually hates his wife's sisters Patty
                    and Selma Bouvier, he played Selma's husband for her to adopt Ling and agreed to be the minister for
                    Patty's intended homosexual marriage. As a result of this, Homer is her legal adoptive father.

                    <br />
                    Homer may just be a normal man, but he has had many great achievements and experiences in his life.
                    He has won a Grammy, an Academy Award, a Pulitzer Prize, been to space and saved Springfield many
                    times.

                    Homer is named after Matt Groening's late father Homer Groening. In a series of interviews in 1990,
                    Groening reportedly stated that he named the character after the Homer Simpson in The Day Of the
                    Locust, a 1939 novel by Nathanael West according to Planet Simpson, but neither explanation is
                    considered definitive.

                    Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9 1981) is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family
                    and one of the two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

                    In Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a
                    train called Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who
                    exceeds the standard achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's
                    surprise, she is also the moral center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental
                    involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding
                    and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by
                    those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only a few friends. She focuses on
                    her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is already a member of
                    Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to those who
                    she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do
                    whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary.
                    Otherwise, she's the intelligent one who usually thinks things through.

                    Simpson family. Maggie is the very young, infant age of 1, born in 1989.
